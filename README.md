## Motivation

Whenever midterm/exam season rolls around, students always scramble to source for past year practice papers, solutions and cheatsheets. Typically, these resources are located across multiple platforms, such as gitHub repositories, google drives or from seniorsâ€™ personal files. More often than not, these papers would also lack proper solutions and explanations.

## Aim

We hope to make the stressful process of preparing for quizzes, midterms and finals easier by offering a centralised platform for students to access and share resources, including past year papers, solutions, cheatsheets and notes. (Cheatsheets, notes and solutions would be generated by the students)

## User stories

1.  As a student who is revising for exams, I want to be able to easily find the resources that I need, especially solutions for difficult questions. It would also be nice if I could be able to identify at a glance the relative difficulty of the papers and validity of the solutions.

2.  As a student revising for exams, I would like to find users studying the same module and work on problems with them, and discuss the optimal solutions.

3.  As a student who has satisfactorily completed the module, I would like to help the coming batches of students by uploading my compiled cheatsheets, notes and proposed solutions.
